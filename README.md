hi :D  

my name is nico, and im new around here - i just started college, which is very generous and gifts their students ✨free stuff✨ sooooo yeah i exist now :3  

i also didn't look at anyone else's readme before starting this one because tbh i have no idea how to find anyone else so uh yeah this will probably not be formatted like they're sUpPoSeD to be or have the right stuff in it or whatever but oh well

anyway actual information you might care about instead of this pointless rambling about how lost and clueless i am :]  

<details>
<summary><h2>about me</h2></summary>
	i feel the need to put something here for now but this is where the construction zone starts oops
